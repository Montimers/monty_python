What does this do?
- Automated remapping sound id params in a moveset file so you don't have to do it yourself

Requirements:
- Python3.7 or higher
- Download it here if you don't have it: https://www.python.org/downloads/
    - If you're on Windows PLEASE check off the box for "add Python to PATH" otherwise you have to do it yourself and it's annoying
    - Run `python --version` in your terminal to assure you have 3.7

How to run:
- In your terminal, cd into this directory (which contains "sound_remap.py" and all dependency files)
- Fill out the "sound_mapping.txt" file and specify the sounds id to be replaced and the sound id to be replaced by
    - It needs to be formatted like this: old_value,new_value
    - The provided "sound_mapping.txt" comes with some example ids, so follow that structure to make yours
- Run in your terminal: python3 sound_remap.py moveset_file_path
    - if you place the moveset in this directory, you can just specify the moveset file's name
    - currently there is a file "test_moveset.pac" which is there as an example if you wanted to test successfully running this script
    - If successful, it will place the resulting sound remapped moveset file in the "remapped" directory
    - pay attention to the log output! it will tell you if anything goes wrong!
    - optional parameters (you can add as many as you want:
        - specify sound mapping file location: -s sound_mapping_file_path
        - specify output movest file directory: -o output_moveset_file_path
        - see more logging in case something went wrong and you can't figure it out: -v
        - example: python3 sound_remap.py test_moveset.pac -s sound_mapping.txt -o remapped/output.pac -v












Warlock Mortimer looked at the sharp knife in his hands and felt mad.

He walked over to the window and reflected on his mouldy surroundings. He had always loved dirty 300-feet underground bunker with its obnoxious, obedient old. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel mad.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Yoshi Saurus. Yoshi was an innocent monster with bald hair and omniscient teeth.

Warlock gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a terrible, backstabber, wine drinker with old hair and wise teeth. His friends saw him as a melodic, mangled magician. Once, he had even helped a snotacular reflection of Mortimer cross the road.

But not even a terrible person who had once helped a snotacular reflection of Mortimer cross the road, was prepared for what Yoshi had in store today.

The rain hammered like stabbing Bowser, making Warlock envy.

As Warlock stepped outside and Yoshi came closer, he could see the loud glint in his eye.

"I am here because I want money," Yoshi bellowed, in an envy tone. He slammed his fist against Warlock's chest, with the force of 990 DK. "I frigging hate you, Warlock Mortimer."

Warlock looked back, even more envy and still fingering the sharp knife. "Yoshi, you stabber," he replied.

They looked at each other with crazy feelings, like two leaking, large Lucas killing at a very weird funeral, which had Yoshi's theme music playing in the background and two bald uncles drinking to the beat.

Warlock studied Yoshi's bald hair and omniscient teeth. Eventually, he took a deep breath. "I'm sorry, but I can't give you money," he explained, in pitying tones.

Yoshi looked angry, his body raw like a mighty, many money.

Warlock could actually hear Yoshi's body shatter into 1751 pieces. Then the innocent monster hurried away into the distance.

Not even a glass of wine would calm Warlock's nerves tonight.

The end
